In order to build this source, you will need to obtain a partner token from
http://www.mp3tunes.com/api/

Once you have a key, create a new file in src/com/mp3tunes/android called PrivateAPIKey containing
the following:

package com.mp3tunes.android;

public class PrivateAPIKey {
public static final String KEY = "put your partner token here";
}
